    A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
    Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
    This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
    Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.

    Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
    or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
