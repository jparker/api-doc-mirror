      base.extend(ClassMethods)

    # Transactions are protective blocks where SQL statements are only permanent if they can all succeed as one atomic action.
    # The classic example is a transfer between two accounts where you can only have a deposit if the withdrawal succeeded and
    # vice versa. Transactions enforce the integrity of the database and guard the data against program errors or database break-downs.
    # So basically you should use transaction blocks whenever you have a number of statements that must be executed together or
    # not at all. Example:
    #
    #   transaction do
    #     david.withdrawal(100)
    #     mary.deposit(100)
    #   end
    #
    # This example will only take money from David and give to Mary if neither +withdrawal+ nor +deposit+ raises an exception.
    # Exceptions will force a ROLLBACK that returns the database to the state before the transaction was begun. Be aware, though,
    # that the objects will _not_ have their instance data returned to their pre-transactional state.
    #
    # == Different Active Record classes in a single transaction
    #
    # Though the transaction class method is called on some Active Record class,
    # the objects within the transaction block need not all be instances of
    # that class.
    # In this example a &lt;tt&gt;Balance&lt;/tt&gt; record is transactionally saved even
    # though &lt;tt&gt;transaction&lt;/tt&gt; is called on the &lt;tt&gt;Account&lt;/tt&gt; class:
    #
    #   Account.transaction do
    #     balance.save!
    #     account.save!
    #   end
    #
    # == Transactions are not distributed across database connections
    #
    # A transaction acts on a single database connection.  If you have
    # multiple class-specific databases, the transaction will not protect
    # interaction among them.  One workaround is to begin a transaction
    # on each class whose models you alter:
    #
    #   Student.transaction do
    #     Course.transaction do
    #       course.enroll(student)
    #       student.units += course.units
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # This is a poor solution, but full distributed transactions are beyond
    # the scope of Active Record.
    #
    # == Save and destroy are automatically wrapped in a transaction
    #
    # Both Base#save and Base#destroy come wrapped in a transaction that ensures that whatever you do in validations or callbacks
    # will happen under the protected cover of a transaction. So you can use validations to check for values that the transaction
    # depends on or you can raise exceptions in the callbacks to rollback.
    #
    # == Exception handling
    #
    # Also have in mind that exceptions thrown within a transaction block will be propagated (after triggering the ROLLBACK), so you
    # should be ready to catch those in your application code. One exception is the ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, which will
    # trigger a ROLLBACK when raised, but not be re-raised by the transaction block.
